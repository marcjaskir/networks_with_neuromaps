## Networks with neuromaps

### Description
The recently developed Python-based toolbox neuromaps provides access to a growing repository of reference brain maps from a diverse set of neuroscience publications. The integration of these datasets with neuromaps’ functionality affords the opportunity to explore multi-modal relationships between existing brain maps and to generate or test hypotheses with new brain maps. By creating a network representation of the correlation structure between all available reference maps included with neuromaps (n=70) and partitioning the networks into communities, I proposed a framework by which new data can be contextualized within a large literature by its spatial correspondence with community spatial averages. This approach can boost statistical power by obviating unnecessary statistical comparisons.
